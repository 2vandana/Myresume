        As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get 
        overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, 
        dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?
        Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can
         take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of front-end
          development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience, 
          and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use
           your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality of your site.  Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.
